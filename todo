[x] when a player connects, send it the info about all connected players
[x] buffer the last position of connected clients so it can get sent out to all incoming connections
[x] store messages in a database
[x] get the messages when first loading the game
[ ] setup pushing to glitch
[ ] make player movement a bit better
[ ] audio for the messages
[ ] change text / player color
[ ] whitelist for words (this actually doesn't feel critical for demo? and it seems like a bad idea generally? but like I like it? I dunno)

ideas:
split stuff into rooms to support more simultaneous players, less data
teleport
teleport doors
realms
locking rooms
owners
deletion
fading text
color changing
text size changing
audio scripting
