[x] make player movement a bit better
[x] camera following the player
[ ] only render the text that is on screen
[ ] move the server out of the server folder?
[ ] passport js
[ ] instances (special url that you go to get a new room)
[ ] add in some kind of analytics
[ ] audio for the messages
[ ] change text / player color
[ ] whitelist for words (this actually doesn't feel critical for demo? and it seems like a bad idea generally? but like I like it? I dunno)
[ ] switch over to pnpm locally, it seems much better than npm

ideas:
split stuff into rooms to support more simultaneous players, less data
teleport
teleport doors
realms
locking rooms
owners
deletion
fading text
color changing
text size changing
audio scripting

on glitch console, need to do pull / refresh

note, to make this run, we need to "watch server" and "build client"
